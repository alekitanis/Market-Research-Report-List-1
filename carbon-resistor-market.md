<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carbon-Composition Resistor</li><li>Carbon-Film Resistor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carbon resistor market primarily includes two types: carbon-composition and carbon-film resistors. Carbon-composition resistors use a mixture of carbon powder and a binding agent, providing high stability and power handling but offering less precision. In contrast, carbon-film resistors are made by depositing a thin layer of carbon onto a ceramic substrate, resulting in better temperature stability, lower noise, and greater accuracy. Both types cater to different applications, balancing factors like cost, performance, and reliability in electronic circuits.</p></p>
